 NAME:
        BARGRAPH

 PURPOSE:
        Creates a bar graph from a vector of data points.

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BARGRAPH, DATA, BASELINE [,keywords]

 INPUTS
        DATA -> Vector of data points to be plotted as a bargraph.
 
        BASELINE -> Vector of points to be used as a baseline for 
             DATA (i.e., Y(I) = DATA(I) + BASELINE(I) ).  If BASELINE 
             is not specified, its default value will be an array 
             of zeroes.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /OVERPLOT -> Set this switch to prevent the current plot
             window from being erased.  This is useful for producing 
             stacked bar plots with successive calls to BARGRAPH.
 
        BARWIDTH -> The width of the bars.  If BARWIDTH is not
            specified, its default value will be 1.0.

        BARCOLOR -> a value or an array containing the colorindex for
            all boxes or each box, respectively. If a single value
            is given, *all* boxes will have this color. If an array 
            is passed that has less elements than there are groups to 
            plot, the remaining colors will be filled with 15 (grey 
            in MYCT standard-scheme).  

        BARLABELS -> A string array of labels to be plotted above each
            bar.  If BARLEVELS may be originally set equal to the
            DATA vector, and it will be converted to the string 
            representation of DATA, using the FORMAT statement 
            contained in L_FORMAT.

        BARCHARSIZE -> Character size for BARLABELS.  Default is 1.0.

        COLOR -> Color index for the plot axes and labels.  
            Default is !MYCT.BLACK.

        L_FORMAT -> The FORMAT statement used to convert BARLABELS
            from a numeric array to a string array.

        /NO_LABELS -> Set this switch to suppress printing the labels
            contained in the BARLABELS atop each bar.  This is useful 
            for producing stacked bar plots.

        XLABELS -> A string array containing the labels that will be 
            printed underneath each bar on the X-axis.  

            NOTE: If /HORIZONTAL is set, then these labels will be 
            printed along the Y-axis instead.

            ALSO NOTE: IDL only allows a maximum limit of 60 ticks 
            along any axis.  If XLABELS has more than 58 elements
            (also allowing for null labels at the beginning and end
            of the plot range), then the labels will not be printed.

        YRANGE -> Use this keyword to specify the range of the data 
            values.  If YRANGE is not specified, then YRANGE will be 
            computed based on the maximum value of the DATA array.  
            For stacked plots, it is useful to compute YRANGE in the 
            calling program and pass it to BARGRAPH. 

            NOTE: If HORIZONTAL is set, then the YRANGE settings 
            will apply to the X-axis instead.

        /HORIZONTAL -> Set this switch to plot the bars in the 
            horizontal instead of in the vertical.  NOTE: In this
            case, the YRANGE settings will be applied to the X-axis.
            and the XRANGE and XLABELS settings will be applied to
            the Y-axis.

        _EXTRA=e -> Passes extra keywords to PLOT and other routines.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        None
        
 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) This routine has been modified to be more general and 
            more robust than the original version in the IDL 5.0 
            User's Guide (p. 170).

        (2) IDL 5.x array notation [] is now used.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)

        BARGRAPH, [1,2,3], BARWIDTH=1.0, BARCOLOR=[10,11,12]
           XLABELS=['Bart', 'Lisa', 'Maggie']

             ; Create a simple bar graph with bars of 3 different 
             ; colors, using a baseline of zero.

        (2)

        DATA   = [2,3.5,6,7,2,1]
        DATA2  = 0.0*DATA + 2

        BARGRAPH, DATA, XLABELS=['A','B','C','D','E','F'],  $
           XSTYLE=1, BARWIDTH=0.8

        BARGRAPH, DATA2, DATA, BARWIDTH=0.8 ,/OVERPLOT, $
           BARCOLOR=2, BARLABELS=DATA+DATA2, L_FORMAT='(F8.2)'             


             ; Use successive calls to BARGRAPH to create a 
             ; "stacked" bar graph with two different data vectors.  
             ; The first vector is used as the baseline for the
             ; second.  The BARLABELS array is created from the actual 
             ; data values.

        (3) 

        BARGRAPH, [1,2,3], BARWIDTH=1.0, BARCOLOR=[10,11,12]
           XLABELS=['Bart', 'Lisa', 'Maggie'], /HORIZONTAL

             ; Same as example (1), but plot bars in the horizontal.

 NAME:
        BOXPLOT

 PURPOSE:
        Produce a box and whisker plot of a data vector

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BOXPLOT,DATA [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DATA  --> the data vector

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        GROUP --> array of the same dimension as DATA which contains
             grouping information. One box is plotted for each group.
             If MINGROUP or MAXGROUP are given, boxes and whiskers are
             only plotted for group values within this range.
             GROUP may not contain more than 28 different values.
             Group can also be a string array. In this case MINGROUP
             and MAXGROUP make no sense of course.

        MINGROUP --> the minimum group value for which a box shall be
             plotted

        MAXGROUP --> the maximum group value for which a box shall be
             plotted

        LABEL --> string array containing labels for *different* groups.
             NOTE: The user must take care that one label is passed for
             each group to be plotted. If label is not specified, the
             group values will be used as axis labels

        COLOR --> plotting color for axis (default : 1, i.e. black in MYCT
             color scheme). Will also be used as default for BOXCOLOR.

        BOXCOLOR --> color of the boxes (frames). Default is the COLOR
             value, i.e. 1 if not specified. This color will also be used as
             default for MEDIANCOLOR and MEANCOLOR. If you want boxes that 
             are only filled but have no frame, you must specify BOXCOLOR=-1.
             In this case the default for MEDIANCOLOR and MEANCOLOR will
             be the COLOR value.

        BOXWIDTH --> relative width of boxes (default: 0.8).

        BOXPOSITION --> relative position of box on x axis (default: 0.).
             This parameter can be used together with the OVERPLOT keyword
             to plot multiple groups of boxes in one graph.

        MEDIANCOLOR --> a color value for the median bar
             (default: value of BOXCOLOR)

        MEANSYMBOL --> symbol to be used for mean values. If no symbol
             is given, no mean values will be drawn.

        MEANCOLOR --> color for mean symbols (default: value of BOXCOLOR)

        FILLCOLOR --> a value or an array containing the colorindex for all
             boxes or each box, respectively. If a single value is given,
             *all* boxes will be filled with this color. If an array is 
             passed that has less elements than there are groups to plot, 
             the remaining colors will be filled with 15 (grey in MYCT 
             standard-scheme). If no FILLCOLOR is specified, the boxes will 
             be empty.

        MISSING --> a value that represents missing data. If given, any data
             with a value of missing will be filtered out before plotting.

        PRINTN --> print number of elements on top of each box/whisker

        CHARSIZE --> character size of the PRINTN labels (default: 0.8)

        /OVERPLOT --> do not draw a new coordinate system but overlay new
             data. For 2 sets of data you should use BOXWIDTH=0.4 and
             BOXPOSITION=-0.25 and 0.25, respectively.

        ORIENTATION -> orientation for axis labels (see XYOUTS procedure)

        /IS_PERCENTILE --> data are already processed percentiles. In this
             case data must be an array with dimensions 5,N. The GROUP keyword
             is ignored, and each set of the N percentiles will be treated as
             one group.

        PERCVAL --> float array with 5 elements denoting the percentile
             values (default: 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95)

        Further keywords are passed to the PLOT routine and can be used
        to determine the appearance of the plot (e.g. XTITLE,YTITLE,
        YSTYLE,YRANGE,/YLOG,COLOR,THICK)

 NAME:
        BPCH2ASCII

 PURPOSE:
        Translates data from GAMAP-readable binary punch file v. 2.0 
        format to a simple ASCII file format
       
 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2ASCII, INFILE, OUTFILE [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the ASCII file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2ASCII will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.ascii".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in ASCII format to OUTFILE.

        /VERBOSE -> If set, then BPCH2ASCII will also echo the
             header lines for each data block to the screen.

        FORMAT -> String containing the numeric format for
             for the data values.  Default is '(7(e13.6,1x))'

 OUTPUTS:
         None

 SUBROUTINES:
         External Subroutines Required:
         =============================================
         CTM_GET_DATA         TAU2YYMMDD    (function)
         GETMODELANDGRIDINFO  REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
         UNDEFINE

 REQUIREMENTS:
         References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2ASCII assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same grid.  This will be true for output
            files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (2) BPCH2ASCII will write a separate ASCII file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (3) BPCH2NC will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may be either in uppercase or lowercase.

        (4) The format of the ASCII file is:

               Data block #1 header line
               Data block #1 values (format specified by FORMAT keyword)
               Data block #2 header line
               Data block #2 values (format specified by FORMAT keyword)
                ...

             The header line will contain the units and size of
             each data block.

        (5) The data is written to the ASCII file in column-major 
            order (i.e. the same way as in FORTRAN), so you can read 
            the data into FORTRAN w/ the following code:

                  READ( IUNIT, '(a)' ) HEADER
                  READ( IUNIT, '(1p,7(e13.6,1x))' )
            &       ((DATA(I,J), I=1,IMX), J=1,JMX)

            where IMX and JMX are the dimensions of the data block.       
     

 EXAMPLE:
         BPCH2ASCII, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.ascii'
        
             ; Read data from binary punch file 'myfile.bpch'
             ; and writes it to ASCII file 'myfile.bpch.ascii'.

 NAME:
        BPCH2COARDS

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in a
        COARDS-compliant netCDF (network Common Data Format) file.

        NOTE: COARDS is a formatting standard for netCDF files which
        is widely used in both the atmospheric & climate communities.
        COARDS-compliant netCDF files can be read by GAMAP, GrADS and
        other plotting packages.
        
        See http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html
        for more information about the COARDS standard.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2COARDS, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If INFILE
             is not passed, the user will be prompted to supply a 
             file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% (or %date%)
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2COARDS will write a separate
             netCDF file for each unique YYYYMMDD value contained
             within the *.bpch file.  If OUTFILE is not specified,
             BPCH2COARDS will use the default file name 
             "coards.%DATE%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> Array of diagnostic categories from the bpch file
             to save to netCDF format.  If omitted, BPCH2COARDS will 
             save all diagnostic categories.  
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the name of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.  Useful
             for debugging purposes.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for NCDF_SET

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2COARDS assumes that each data block in the *.bpch
            file is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2COARDS assumes that the number type of each data 
            block in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2COARDS assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2COARDS will write a separate COARDS-compliant netCDF
            file corresponding to each unique YYYYMMDD date.  This 
            prevents the files from becoming too large to be read
            with IDL.

        (5) BPCH2COARDS will replace the %DATE% (or %date%) token with
            the current YYYYMMDD value.  Therefore, it is recommended
            to insert this token into the string passed via OUTFILE.

        (6) BPCH2COARDS will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the eta or sigma centers will also be written to the
            file.  Time will be written as TAU values (i.e. hours
            since 00:00 GMT on 01-Jan-1985.

        (7) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2COARDS, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more COARDS-compliant netCDF files adhering
            ; to the filename convention "myfile.YYYYMMDD.nc"

 NAME:
        BPCH2NC

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in
        netCDF (network Common Data Format) format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2NC, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2NC will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in netCDF format to OUTFILE.
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the names of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for NCDF_SET

 OUTPUTS:

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ============================================
        B2N_Valid_VarName (function)
        B2N_SetNcDim      (function)
        B2N_GetNcDim      (function)

        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2NC assumes that each data block in the *.bpch file
            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2NC assumes that the number type of each data block
            in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2NC assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2NC will write a separate NC file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (5) BPCH2NC will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may also be passed in lowercase (e.g,  %date%, %time% ).  

        (6) BPCH2NC will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the sigma centers will also be written to the file.  
            Date and time are stored as global attributes.

        (7) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2NC, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more netCDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.nc"

 NAME:
        BPCH2PCH

 PURPOSE:
        Translates data from GAMAP-readable binary punch
        file v. 2.0 format to the ancient ASCII-punch
        file standard.
       
 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2PCH, FILENAME [, OUTFILENAME [, Keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the binary punch file from which 
             to read data.  FILENAME may be a file mask, and may
             contain wild card characters (e.g. ~/ctm.bpch.*). If
             FILENAME is omitted or contains a wild card character,
             the user will be prompted to pick a file via a dialog box.

        OUTFILENAME (optional) -> Name of the output ASCII punch
             file.  Default is 'ASCIIfile.pch' 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in ASCII punch format
              to OUTFILE.

         /EXTRA_SPACE -> If set, will put an extra space between
             the numbers in the ASCII punch file.  This might 
             be necessary when using MATLAB or S-PLUS to read
             in the ASCII punch file.

 OUTPUTS:
         Writes data to ASCII punch file format

 SUBROUTINES:
         CTM_GET_DATA 

 REQUIREMENTS:
         References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
         Some limitations:
         (1) Works only for global lon-lat diagnostics.           
         (2) The top header line might be inaccurate (but nobody
             really reads that anyway, so forget it for now...)

 EXAMPLE:
         BPCH2PCH, '~/bmy/ctm.bpch', '~/bmy/ctm.pch'
        
             ; Reads data from binary punch file '~/bmy/ctm.bpch'
             ; and writes it to ASCII punch file '~/bmy/ctm.pch'.

 NAME:
        BPCH_SEP

 PURPOSE:
        Separates data from one binary punch file into another binary 
        punch file by time (TAU0), tracer, or location indices.  Useful 
        for making smaller bpch files so that we don't run out of IDL 
        memory when reading/processing them.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:p
        BPCH_SEP, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> A path name or file mask (with wildcards) 
             which indicates the names of the individual files
             to be linked together in a single bpch file.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the bpch file that will contain data
             from the individual bpch files specified by INFILES.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> Array of diagnostic categories for which to 
             save out to OUTFILE  Default is to save all diagnostic
             categories to OUTFILE.

        TAU0 -> Time index (hours from 1 Jan 1985) denoting the
             data blocks to be saved from INFILE to OUTFILE.  You
             can use NYMD2TAU to compute this from a YYYYMMDD date.

        TRACER -> Tracer number(s) for which to save to OUTFILE.  
             Default is to save all tracers.

        II, JJ, KK -> Longitude, latitude, altitude index arrays used
             to cut down the data block to less than global size.

        CTM_DIAGINFO    LITTLE_ENDIAN (function)
        OPEN_FILE       UNDEFINE 

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) Assumes that II, JJ, LL contain consecutive indices in
            longitude, latitude, and altitude, respectively.

        (2) Also assumes that II, JJ, LL are in IDL notation
            (i.e. starting from zero).  This is so that you can
            pass the output from the WHERE command to BPCH_SEP.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        BPCH_SEP, 'ctm.bpch.big', 'ctm.bpch.small', tau0=140256D

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME (optional) -> Name of the binary punch file to read.
             If omitted, a dialog box will prompt the user to make
             a selection.
             
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /NOPAUSE -> If set, will not pause after displaying information   
             about each data block.  Default is to pause to allow the

 NOTES:
        BPCH_TEST does not return any data values from the binary
        punch file.  It is meant to be used for debugging purposes.

 EXAMPLES:
        BPCH_TEST, 'my.bpch'
