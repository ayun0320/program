    thru GAMAP 1.48 (last updated 28 Aug 2001)

    * color handling: until today I never got true color to work on Unix
      machines. Now I found out that gamap doesn't work well in this mode.
      GAMAP has been tested in 8 bit color depth on Unix and Linux and
      in true color mode on the Windows platform. In true color mode,
      animations are screwed up. On 8 bit displays the number of colors
      used may be sometimes too limited.

    * Positioning of title and colorbars may still be refinable for odd
      multipanel plots (eh, 12 panels isn't that odd!). Try out the
      MPosition and CBPosition keywords if you want to get fancy!

    * The C_LABELS keyword to contour plots is not honored.

    * The documentation does not mention the new regridding routines
      (regridv, sumv and the read_mdl.pro example file).

    * Conversion of TAU -> YYMMDD for GISS-II and GISS-II-PRIME data
      may be inaccurate since GISS wind fields do not take leap years 
      into account.  


    bmy, 20 Jan 1999 -- GAMAP 1.44

    * GAMAP 1.44 must be run on IDL v. 5.3 and higher, since certain
      IDL routines (rstrpos, str_sep) from previous IDL releases have
      been obsoleted in v. 5.3.  


    bmy, 20 Jun 2000 -- GAMAP 1.45
	
    * No further bugs have been reported at this time    


    bmy, 03 Oct 2000 -- GAMAP 1.46
	
    * No further bugs have been reported at this time


    bmy, 28 Aug 2001 -- GAMAP 1.48

    * No further bugs have been reported at this time


    bmy, 29 Jan 2004 -- GAMAP 2.01

    * Many things have been totally updated in GAMAP v2-01, so it 
      should be a lot more user-friendly than the earliest GAMAP
      versions were.  
 
    * Sometimes there is a problem when you use CTM_GET_DATABLOCK
      to read less-than-global data blocks.  The array returned by
      CTM_GET_DATABLOCK may still be of global data size even if the
      array is of less-than-global size.  It is best to always use
      LON, LAT, and LEV keywords to specify a data block's dimensions
      when using CTM_GET_DATABLOCK.

    * Many of the routines in GAMAP v2-01 have been rewritten so that
      the heap memory associated with the pointer DataInfo.Data is
      freed after each use.  In previous versions, this memory was
      not freed, which would result in GAMAP using up all of the
      available IDL memory.
