Dear IDL Users,

      I have assembled an IDL library that includes statistical, plotting and
general mathematical utility routines from in-house (developed in OPT) and
various (astronomical library and Code 916 library) sources.  They are
installed on HOSS, QHEARTS and JWOCKY.  On QHEARTS and JWOCKY, the source
listings of the library are put in the subdirectory
/usr/local/lib/idl/lib/opt_lib/.  On HOSS, since the astronomical and the Code
916 libraries are fully installed, only the in-house routines are grouped into
an auxiliary library (/usr/local/lib/idl/aulib/).  Users are urged to take a
look at this library and make use of these routines.  On-line help is
available through the IDL command doc_library.  I would like to high-light
some of these assembled routines.

      Regressions, especially nonparametric data smoothing methods, are
routine methods in our research.  However, most standard data smoothing
methods are NOT end-point sensitive.

      Two in-house routines, CLOESS and GCVSPL, have been developed to address
the nonparametric data smoothing problem with end-points sensitivity.  CLOESS
is based on a local regression method with which users may study the
appropriate degree of smoothness applied to a data set.  It is a useful tool
to look at a data set without an 'a priori' prejudice of what the model should
look like.  On the other hand, GCVSPL is a smoothing spline routine that
determines the optimal degree of smoothing to a data set based on the method
of generalized cross validation (GCV).  It offers an "objective" method of
smoothing a data set.

      Other nonparametric forms of regression and data smoothing include a
simple binning routine BIN (Binning based on fixed bin width) developed as an
in-house routine, SMOOTH (Box-car running average to smooth noisy data), and
CONVOL (Smoothing by convolution with user-specified kernel) in the standard
IDL Routines, and a routine POLY_SMOOTH (Smoothing using self-convolution) in
the astronomical library.  None of these routines are end-point sensitive.

      For parametric regression, two routines, POLY_FIT (Curve fitting with a
nth degree polynomial function) and CURVEFIT (Curve fitting with a user
specified function), are already available in the default IDL Users' Library.

      There are also some general utility routines in the library that users
may find useful.  Examples of them include SURFCAT (determines for each pair
of latitude and longitude in a data set if the location is over sea, over
land, over low inland, over land and water, etc.), AIRTOVAC (air to vacuum
wavelength), VACTOAIR (vacuum to air wavelength) and MONOTONIC (determine if a
vector is monotonic).

      Users are urged to use the library and advise me of any problems that
may come up.  More useful routines will be added to the existing library in
the future.  Thanks.

                                          Andy Au
