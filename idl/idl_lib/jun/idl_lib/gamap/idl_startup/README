This directory contains a sample idl_startup.pro directory for use with GAMAP.

It is recommended to copy this idl_startup.pro file to your ~/IDL directory.

Also make sure that your .cshrc file has the following line:

    setenv IDL_STARTUP $home/IDL/idl_startup.pro

This will define the IDL_STARTUP environment variable.  This variable tells
IDL where to look for the "idl_startup.pro" file.

You may edit the "idl_startup.pro" file as you wish (e.g. to add more
IDL source code directories to the search path).  Please see Chapter 2 
of the GAMAP User's Guide for more information.
