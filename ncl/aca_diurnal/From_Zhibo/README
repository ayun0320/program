steps:

1) read in ACA_data, use sampled_grids_lat_index & sampled_grids_lon_index to locate the grid
2) South East Atlantic Region 30S~10N; -20W~20E, July; August; Sep.
2) use CALIOP_ACA_count to find ACA case, CALIOP_ACA_count>0 means this grid has ACA, CALIOP_ACA_count=0 no ACA
3) read in ACA layer bottom pressure CALIOP_ACA_lbp_mean
4) use CALIOP_ACA_lbp_mean and Terra_cot_ctp_hist to find clouds below ACA
5) compare clean with ACA grids: Terra vs. Aqua cloud fraction & Cloud optical thickness
